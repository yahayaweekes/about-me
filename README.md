# about-me
I am currently a CO in Rhode Island. I just recently had a daughter. I've been in Massachusetts almost nine years now. I am looking forward to this program. I did HTML and CSS while I was in high school and I enjoyed it. Now that I have a daughter I hope to spend more time with her and I believe I'll be able to do this once I master the art of coding.
